 			<p class="title1">Heart and Soul</p>
 			<br>
			<p>Heart and soul, I fell in love with you</p>
			<p>Heart and soul, the way a fool would do, madly</p>
			<p>Because you held me tight</p>
			<p>And stole a kiss in the night</p>
			<p>Heart and soul, I begged to be adored</p>
			<p>Lost control, and tumbled overboard, gladly</p>
			<p>That magic night we kissed</p>
			<p>There in the moon mist</p>
			<p>Oh! but your lips were thrilling, much too thrilling</p>
			<p>Never before were mine so strangely willing</p>
			<p>But now I see, what one embrace can do</p>
			<p>Look at me, it's got me loving you madly</p>
			<p>That little kiss you stole</p>
			<p>Held all my heart and soul</p>
